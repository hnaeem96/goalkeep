## GoalKeep

Welcome to GoalKeep! A mini-social network web app where you can add, complete, delete, and copy goals.
The great thing about GoalKeep is you can see other people's goals and everything updates realtime. This
app was made using React, Redux, and Firebase. I'm currently still working on it, but feel free to take a look!
